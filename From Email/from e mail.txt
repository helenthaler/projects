I get messages every single day from people who say they're lonely;
they wish they had more friends; they wish they had someone to talk to,
or share hobbies with. I'm writing this newsletter because so many of
you said, "Yes! I want to make new friends too!" You don't know that
anyone is "too busy" or has "enough friends already." Please don't
assign other people feelings, said with love.

* If they say no, it means there's something wrong with me

If they say no, it's not about you. Maybe they're in a difficult
season (like I was at the height of my concussion). Maybe they're shy
or serious introverts. Maybe they're in a high-pressure job that keeps
them on the road. Maybe they already have a tight circle of friends and
aren't in a place where they want to expand it. Maybe you're not
their friend type. That STILL doesn't say anything about you-it's
just their lamp. 

* I'll never find friends as good as the ones I left

That's a terrible story, and if you want to keep it, I'll let you,
but what would your life be if you just didn't believe that was true?
(I bet it would make the friend search so exciting, and you'd be more
likely to attract the kind of people you were seeking, and it would make
you discerning, which means you wouldn't settle for friends that
weren't as good to you as you wanted to be for them.)

A concept called "the liking gap" may reassure you here: Research shows
that when strangers interact, they're more liked by the other person
than they assume. Plus, when you go into conversations assuming the
other person likes you (and without your stories), you'll show up more
openly, warmly, and engagingly. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy!

The where

If you want to make friends, go do things and visit places you'd want
to do or be with friends. You might meet someone nice at a bar, but if
you're not a big drinker, it doesn't make sense to try to strike up
a friendship there. 

* Join a gym, or even better, a women's only gym. (Yoga studios may
work, but I've found everyone is quiet when they come in and leave
quickly, so it's harder to chat.)

* Find a group through Meetup. You can find all kinds of interests
represented-hiking, rock climbing, yoga, book clubs, crafting, games,
tarot reading, trivia, volunteer work, support groups-they're all
there! 

* Take a class. You can find free or inexpensive courses through your
local university on everything from languages to computer science to
arts. A class that meets regularly for eight to twelve weeks is a great
way to meet new people with similar interests.

* Join an app! From Bumble BFF to Yubo to Wink, there are apps out there
connecting friends all over the country
